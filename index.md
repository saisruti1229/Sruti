 Hello, I am Sai Sruti, a junior at East Brunswick High School. Here are three things in High School that I was proud of: 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
I am proud of taking classes that are out of my comfort zone. Throughout high school, I have been a versatile student and took a diverse set of classes. 
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
I am proud of making meaningful connections. During my time at the high school, I have made many connections and friendships that I would not have otherwise if I hadnâ€™t stepped out of my bubble.

Lastly, I am proud of the consistency of my extracurricular activities from freshmen year until now that are unaffected by the courseload and work.
